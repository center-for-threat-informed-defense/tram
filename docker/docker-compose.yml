# TRAM compose file.
#  - TRAM is currently setup to use Django with SQLite DB
#  - TRAM currently only works from localhost on port 8000 (or whatever port you select here)
#  - Any ML data and DB data is stored at the path stored in the environment variable
#    `DATA_DIRECTORY`. This is internal to Django.
#  - ALLOWED_HOSTS is a list of hosts allowed to connect to the Django server (in settings.py)
#  - CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS is a list of origins allowed to requests to the Django server (in settings.py)
#  - SECRET_KEY is generated at startup to a random value. Set SECRET_KEY env variable for tram service below
#               to use a static value.
