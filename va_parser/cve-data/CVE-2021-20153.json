    "title": "Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains a symlink vulnerability in the bittorrent functionality. If enabled, the bittorrent functionality is vulnerable to a symlink attack that could lead to remote code execution on the device. If an end user inserts a flash drive with a malicious symlink on it that the bittorrent client can write downloads to, then a user is able to download arbitrary files to any desired location on the devices filesystem, which could lead to remote code execution. Example directories vulnerable to this include config, downloads, and torrents, though it should be noted that downloads is the only vector that allows for arbitrary files to be downloaded to arbitrary locations.",
