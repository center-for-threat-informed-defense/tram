    "title": "A buffer overflow issue leading to denial of service was discovered in HMI3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. When HMI3 starts up, it binds a local service to a TCP port on all interfaces of the device, and takes extensive time for the GUI to connect to the TCP socket, allowing the connection to be hijacked by an external attacker.",
