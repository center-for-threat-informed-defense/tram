The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to a configuration command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input during the execution of this command. A successful exploit could allow a non-privileged attacker authenticated in the restricted CLI to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) with root privileges.",
