Threat Report ATT&CK Mapper (TRAM) is an open-source platform designed to reduce cost
and increase the effectiveness of integrating ATT&CK  across the CTI community. It does
this by automating the mapping of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports to MITRE
ATT&CK®. Threat intel providers, threat intel platforms, and analysts can use TRAM to
integrate ATT&CK more easily and consistently into their products.

The platform works out of the box to identify up to 50 common ATT&CK techniques in text
documents; it also supports tailoring the model by annotating additional items and
rebuilding the model. This Wiki describes the results of the Center for Threat-Informed
Defense (CTID) research into automated ATT&CK mapping and provides details and
instructions for tailoring the platform to your organization's unique dataset.

## Getting Started

The TRAM web application can be deployed in a containerized environment with Docker or
Kubernetes. You should read the installation instructions to make sure that you are
comfortable with the prerequisites. Alternatively, if you want to focus on Machine
Learning Engineering, you can run the project notebooks for fine tuning your own models.

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help advance
threat-informed defense:

- **Install the TRAM web application and try processing CTI reports.** We welcome your
  feedback on the effectiveness of using machine learning to identify TTPs in
  human-readable text.
- **Share your use cases.** We are interested in developing additional tools and
  resources to help the community understand and make threat-informed decisions in their
  risk management programs. If you have ideas or suggestions, we consider them as we
  explore additional research projects.
- **Label your own data and use the notebooks to fine tune your own models.** This is a
  complex undertaking, but it allows you to adapt TRAM to your own environment and data.
  If you have high end GPUs in your environment, you can run these notebooks on your own
  instrastructure; otherwise you can run them on the paid or free tiers of [Google
  Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
