# TRAM v1.0

Threat Report ATT&CK<sup>®</sup> Mapping (TRAM) is a tool that leverages Natural Language Processing to aid analysts in mapping finished reports to ATT&CK. 

There is no shortage of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reporting, and analysts often find themselves overburdened by the constant stream of reports. Analyzing
these reports can be strenuous and tedious for analysts, often taking up large amounts of their time. Automating CTI mapping to ATT&CK will reduce analyst fatigue,
increase ATT&CK coverage and timeliness, and improve consistency of threat intelligence mappings. 

TRAM seeks to help analysts by automatically extracting adversary behaviors, which can help with the acceleration of the analysis process to prevent a backlog. 
With faster analysis, CTI teams can more easily operationalize their intel. While TRAM cannot replace a human analyst, it certainly can help by providing analysts
with some starting data about the report.

TRAM uses natural language processing and classification techniques to extract adversary behaviors (ATT&CK techniques) from raw text which comes in the form of 
published threat reports. The current practice to extract these techniques relies entirely on manual analysis performed by human analysts. This introduces problems
like human error, dependence on physical availability, and demand for an extensive understanding of ATT&CK. With automation, this project will increase the quality
and completeness of the ATT&CK knowledge base while reducing demand on human analysts.

## Requirements
- [python3](https://www.python.org/) (3.7+)
- Google Chrome is our only supported/tested browser

## Installation
Start by cloning this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/tram.git
```
Create a virtual environment
```
virtualenv TRAMenv
```
and activate it
```
source TRAMenv/bin/activate
```
Or for Windows
```
TRAMenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
From the root of this project, install the PIP requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We use nltk and spacy, so you must download the necessary nltk and spacy librarys in a python interpreter.
```
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Afterwards, make sure you download the model and training data and place them within the data directory
```
https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram/releases
```

Then start the server.
```
python server.py
```
Once the server has started, point your browser to localhost:9999, you must first login. credentials are admin:admin but you can
change them in the default.yml file.

Previously, TRAM was started by running `python tram.py`. The tram.py file now is used for the TRAM library.

## Documentation

After starting the TRAM server, you can read the documentation for TRAM here: http://localhost:9999/docs/index.html.

## How do I contribute?

We welcome all the help we can get in making TRAM a more useful tool for the community. 
We have made a working prototype and acknowledge that there will need to be increased efforts in the future to maintain 
and improve it.
If you have any issues with TRAM, you can create an issue in the issues tab, we'll try to respond as soon as possible.
