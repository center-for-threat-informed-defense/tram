# TRAM

Threat Report ATT&CK Mapping (TRAM) is an open-source platform designed to advance research into automating the mapping of cyber threat intelligence reports to MITRE ATT&CK®.

TRAM enables researchers to test and refine Machine Learning (ML) models for identifying ATT&CK techniques in prose-based cyber threat intel reports and allows threat intel analysts to train ML models and validate ML results. 

Through research into automating the mapping of cyber threat intel reports to ATT&CK, TRAM aims to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of integrating ATT&CK into cyber threat intelligence across the community. Threat intel providers, threat intel platforms, and analysts should be able to use TRAM to integrate ATT&CK more easily and consistently into their products.

## Requirements
- [python3](https://www.python.org/) (3.7+)
- Google Chrome is our only supported/tested browser

## Developer Setup
Start by cloning this repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram.git
```
Change to the TRAM directory
```
cd tram/
```
Create a virtual environment
```
virtualenv venv
```
and activate it
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Or for Windows
```
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```
set up the database
```
python src/tram/manage.py makemigrations tram
python src/tram/manage.py migrate
```
create a superuser (web login)
```
python src/tram/manage.py createsuperuser
```
Run the webserver
```
python src/tram/manage.py runserver 
```
Then you can navigate to http://localhost:8000 and use the superuser to log in

In a separate terminal window, run the ML pipeline
```
cd tram/
source venv/bin/activate
python src/tram/manage.py pipeline run
```
