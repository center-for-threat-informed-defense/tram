# TRAM

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=YISO1NSAMZ)](https://codecov.io/gh/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram)

Threat Report ATT&CK Mapping (TRAM) is an open-source platform designed to
advance research into automating the mapping of cyber threat intelligence
reports to MITRE ATT&CKÂ®.

TRAM enables researchers to test and refine Machine Learning (ML) models for
identifying ATT&CK techniques in prose-based cyber threat intel reports and
allows threat intel analysts to train ML models and validate ML results.

Through research into automating the mapping of cyber threat intel reports to
ATT&CK, TRAM aims to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of
integrating ATT&CK into cyber threat intelligence across the community. Threat
intel providers, threat intel platforms, and analysts should be able to use TRAM
to integrate ATT&CK more easily and consistently into their products.

## Installation

1. Get Docker: <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>
2. Get Docker Compose:  <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>
3. Ensure Docker is running. On some operating systems (e.g., MacOS), you will
   need to provide Docker with permissions before proceeding.
4. Download docker-compose.yml (view raw, save as)

    ```url
    https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml
    ```

5. If desired, edit the settings in `docker-compose.yml`
6. Navigate to the directory where you saved `docker-compose.yml`
7. Run TRAM using docker

    ```shell
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
    ```

8. Navigate to <http://localhost:8000/> and login using the username and
password specified in docker-compose.yml

### Air Gap Installation

If you are unable to pull images from Docker Hub (i.e. due to corporate
firewall, airgap, etc.), it is possible to download the images and move them
onto the Docker host manually:

1. Pull the images onto a machine that is able to access Docker Hub:

    ```shell
    $ docker pull ghcr.io/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram:latest
    $ docker pull ghcr.io/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram-nginx:latest
    ```

2. Export the Docker images to compressed archive (`.tgz`) format:

    ```shell
    $ docker save ghcr.io/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram:latest \
        | gzip > tram-latest.tgz
    $ docker save ghcr.io/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram-nginx:latest \
        | gzip > tram-nginx-latest.tgz
    ```
3. Confirm that the images were exported correctly.

    ```shell
    ls -lah tram*.tgz
    -rw-r--r--  1 johndoe  wheel   345M Feb 24 12:56 tram-latest.tgz
    -rw-r--r--  1 johndoe  wheel   9.4M Feb 24 12:57 tram-nginx-latest.tgz
    ```

4. Copy the images across the airgap.
   - _This step will depend on your deployment environment, of course._

5. Import the Docker images on the Docker host.

    ```shell
    $ docker load < tram-latest.tgz
    $ docker load < tram-nginx-latest.tar.gz
    ```

6. Confirm that the images were loaded on the Docker host.

    ```shell
    $ docker images | grep tram
    ghcr.io/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram-nginx   latest    8fa8fb7801b9   2 weeks ago    23.5MB
    ghcr.io/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram         latest    d19b35523098   2 weeks ago    938MB
    ```

7. From this point, you can follow the main installation instructions above.

## Installation Troubleshooting

### \[97438\] Failed to execute script docker-compose

If you see this stack trace:

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "docker-compose", line 3, in <module>
  File "compose/cli/main.py", line 81, in main
  File "compose/cli/main.py", line 200, in perform_command
  File "compose/cli/command.py", line 60, in project_from_options
  File "compose/cli/command.py", line 152, in get_project
  File "compose/cli/docker_client.py", line 41, in get_client
  File "compose/cli/docker_client.py", line 170, in docker_client
  File "docker/api/client.py", line 197, in __init__
  File "docker/api/client.py", line 221, in _retrieve_server_version
docker.errors.DockerException: Error while fetching server API version: ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionRefusedError(61, 'Connection refused'))
[97438] Failed to execute script docker-compose
```

Then most likely Docker is not running and you need to start Docker.

## Report Troubleshooting

### How long until my queued report is complete?

A queued report should only take about a minute to complete.

### Why is my report stuck in queued?

This is likely a problem with the processing pipeline. If the pipeline is not
working when you are running TRAM via docker, then this might be a TRAM-level
bug. If you think this is the case, then please file an issue and we can tell
you how to get logs off the system to troubleshoot.

### Do I have to manually accept all of the parsed sentences in the report?

Yes. The workflow of TRAM is that the AI/ML process will propose mappings, but a
human analyst needs to validate/accept the proposed mappings.

## Requirements

* [python3](https://www.python.org/) (3.7+)
* Google Chrome is our only supported/tested browser

## For Developers

### Developer Setup

The following steps are only required for local development and testing. The
containerized version is recommended for non-developers.

1. Install the following packages using your OS package manager (apt, yum, homebrew, etc.):
   1. make
   2. shellcheck
   3. shfmt

2. Start by cloning this repository.

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram.git
    ```

3. Change to the TRAM directory.

    ```sh
    cd tram/
    ```

4. Create a virtual environment and activate the new virtual environment.
   1. Mac and Linux

      ```sh
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

   2. Windows

      ```bat
      venv\Scripts\activate.bat
      ```

5. Install Python application requirements.

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements/test-requirements.txt
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

6. Install pre-commit hooks

    ```sh
    pre-commit install
    ```

7. Set up the application database.

    ```sh
    tram makemigrations tram
    tram migrate
    ```

8. Run the Machine learning training.

    ```sh
    tram attackdata load
    tram pipeline load-training-data
    tram pipeline train --model nb
    tram pipeline train --model logreg
    tram pipeline train --model nn_cls
    ```

9.  Create a superuser (web login)

    ```sh
    tram createsuperuser
    ```

10. Run the application server

    ```sh
    DEBUG=1 tram runserver
    ```

11. Open the application in your web browser.
    1. Navigate to <http://localhost:8000> and use the superuser to log in
12. In a separate terminal window, run the ML pipeline

     ```sh
     cd tram/
     source venv/bin/activate
     tram pipeline run
     ```

### Makefile Targets

- Run TRAM application
  - `make start-container`
- Stop TRAM application
  - `make stop-container`
- View TRAM logs
  - `make container-logs`
- Build Python virtualenv
  - `make venv`
- Install production Python dependencies
  - `make install`
- Install prod and dev Python dependencies
  - `make install-dev`
- Manually run pre-commit hooks without performing a commit
  - `make pre-commit-run`
- Build container image (By default, container is tagged with timestamp and git hash of codebase) _See note below about custom CA certificates in the Docker build.)_
  - `make build-container`
- Run linting locally
  - `make lint`
- Run unit tests, safety, and bandit locally
  - `make test`

The automated test suite runs inside `tox`, which guarantees a consistent testing
environment, but also has considerable overhead. When writing code, it may be
useful to run `pytest` directly, which is considerably faster and can also be
used to run a specific test. Here are some useful pytest commands:

```shell
# Run the entire test suite:
$ pytest tests/

# Run tests in a specific file:
$ pytest tests/tram/test_models.py

# Run a test by name:
$ pytest tests/ -k test_mapping_repr_is_correct

# Run tests with code coverage tracking, and show which lines are missing coverage:
$ pytest --cov=tram --cov-report=term-missing tests/
```

### Custom CA Certificate

If you are building the container in an environment that intercepts SSL
connections, you can specify a root CA certificate to inject into the container
at build time. (This is only necessary for the TRAM application container. The
TRAM Nginx container does not make outbound connections.)

Export the following two variables in your environment.

```shell
$ export TRAM_CA_URL="http://your.domain.com/root.crt"
$ export TRAM_CA_THUMBPRINT="C7:E0:F9:69:09:A4:A3:E7:A9:76:32:5F:68:79:9A:85:FD:F9:B3:BD"
```

The first variable is a URL to a PEM certificate containing a root certificate
that you want to inject into the container. (If you use an `https` URL, then
certificate checking is disabled.) The second variable is a SHA-1 certificate
thumbprint that is used to verify that the correct certificate was downloaded.
You can obtain the thumbprint with the following OpenSSL command:

```shell
$ openssl x509 -in <your-cert.crt> -fingerprint -noout
SHA1 Fingerprint=C7:E0:F9:69:09:A4:A3:E7:A9:76:32:5F:68:79:9A:85:FD:F9:B3:BD
```

After exporting these two variables, you can run `make build-container` as usual
and the TRAM container will contain your specified root certificate.

## Machine Learning Development

All source code related to machine learning is located in TRAM
[src/tram/ml](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram/tree/master/src/tram/ml).

### Existing ML Models

TRAM has four machine learning models that can be used out-of-the-box:

1. LogisticRegressionModel - Uses SKLearn's [Logistic
   Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html).
2. NaiveBayesModel - Uses SKLearn's [Multinomial
   NB](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB).
3. Multilayer Perception - Uses SKLearn's
   [MLPClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html).
4. DummyModel - Uses SKLearn's [Dummy
   Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html#sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier)
   for testing purposes.

All ML models are implemented as an SKLearn Pipeline. Other types of models can be added in the future if there is a need.

### Creating Your Own ML Model

In order to write your own model, take the following steps:

1. Create a subclass of `tram.ml.base.SKLearnModel` that implements the
   `get_model` function. See existing ML Models for examples that can be copied.

    ```python
    class DummyModel(SKLearnModel):
        def get_model(self):
            # Your model goes here
            return Pipeline([
                ("features", CountVectorizer(lowercase=True, stop_words='english', min_df=3)),
                ("clf", DummyClassifier(strategy='uniform'))
            ])
    ```

2. Add your model to the `ModelManager`
   [registry](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram/blob/a4d874c66efc11559a3faeced4130f153fa12dca/src/tram/tram/ml/base.py#L309)
   1. Note: This method can be improved. Pull requests welcome!

    ```python
    class ModelManager(object):
        model_registry = {
            'dummy': DummyModel,
            'nb': NaiveBayesModel,
            'logreg': LogisticRegressionModel,
            # Your model on the line below
            'your-model': python.path.to.your.model
        }
    ```

3. You can now train your model, and the model will appear in the application
   interface.

   ```sh
   tram pipeline train --model your-model
   ```

4. If you are interested in sharing your model with the community, thank you!
   Please [open a Pull
   Request](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram/pulls)
   with your model, and please include performance statistics in your Pull
   Request description.
